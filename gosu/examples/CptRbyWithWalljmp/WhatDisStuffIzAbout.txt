About and How it Came To Be: ---
This is walljumping with Captain Ruby.
I had recently studied only three tutorials with Ruby and wanted to see how aesome Ruby really was.
My results? Ruby is awesome. I implemented walljumping because it's just cool in general.

If you use any of the code or modification of it, I'd like just an itty-bitty "thank you" or something in the game. If you don't that's fine but if you're a good person you will! *Or Die*

Thanks Julian for Gosu. It is awesome.
